This is a stripped-down and slightly modified fork of the
Extended WPF Toolkitâ„¢ by [Xceed](https://xceed.com).

Since I use only very few of the controls provided by the original toolkit and saw no added value in switching to some other component after the free (beer/speech) edition of the grid was discontinued, I decided to take only the last available freely available grid and link it against the [DotNetProjects fork](https://github.com/dotnetprojects/WpfExtendedToolkit).
